It's been awhile since I last updated the site, and certainly since I updated the blog. I'm going to keep this fairly short, but I just wanted to give an update as to what's happening in my life (and I need to update my about page).

Firstly, I no longer work for Pioneer Telephone, and was recently hired by Paycom as a Software Developer. While I'm still not quite sure what I'll be working on, I've been assigned to an overarching team. I've met a lot of great people who are passionate about what they do, and I feel that in the long run, working for Paycom will be full of great opportunities.

I've been working on a game for iOS and Android that I hope to have finished in a few months time. It's been a great learning experience and I've had the opportunity to experience using established libraries as well as getting a chance to work with an artist to create the assets for the game. At some point in the future, I'd like to post some more about my experience in the planning, design, and development of the game.

Aside from that, I've been looking at ways to improve my quality of life and my overall health. While I haven't run recently, I've been doing yoga when I can, which I've found relaxes me both mentally and physically. I've also begun to eat healthier (it's still hard!) by cooking everything myself and incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and grains into my diet.

I plan to read and write more frequently. Writing is one facet I wish I'd kept up with to grow and maintain my vocabulary and as another mental exercise. It's always been something I loved doing, but have unfortunately fallen away from in recent years. I expect that as my reading continues I will be inspired to write more frequently. Improved skills should also begin to show in these blog posts (this one is certainly rough, and not just around the edges).

I expect great things to happen in my life over the coming years, and I hope to share it with all of you!

Thanks for reading!
