It's taken awhile, but I've finally managed to get a website up and running! I'm hoping to update this blog at least a few times a month with projects I'm working on. The site itself will be primarily used as a portfolio for those projects I'll be creating once they're complete.

Hopefully all goes well with the multitude of projects I'm working on and I also expect this will help and encourage productivity on my creative writing that I do on the side.

Thanks for reading, and be on the look out for things to come!
