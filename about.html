<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I develop a wide range of applications for Pioneer Telephone Cooperative, Inc, a regional telecom company based in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. In my free time I work on independent projects; these range from video games to full stack web applications. I haven't completed anything noteworthy yet, but each project provides the continuing experience I'll require to complete large applications.</p>

<p>The tech industry is what I know and understand best, but I've found in the last couple years a longing to go outside, spending a bit less cooped up at a desk. I've also taken up reading as a way to wind down and enjoy a break from my monitors.</p>

<p>One of my great aspirations is travel. Maybe a bit cliche, but I have a list of places I want to visit in my head with number one being Ireland. The world has tons of culture and experience to offer, and being able to dive into it so readily feels incredible. If you had the chance to travel, where would you go?</p>
